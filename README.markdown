# Carto

Carto is a wrapper that sits on top of certain javascript map providers in order to make it simpler to create applications with their API's

*Itâ€™s a work in progress (e.g. beta), so please be kind and 
contribute! Patches are welcome, but aren't guaranteed to make it in.*

## Usage

alpha usage as follows:

```
var infoWindowContent = '<div id="content"><div id="siteNotice"></div><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Uluru</h1><div id="bodyContent"><p><b>Uluru</b>, also referred to as <b>Ayers Rock</b>, is a large sandstone rock formation in the southern part of the Northern Territory, central Australia.
