# Carto

Carto is a wrapper that sits on top of certain javascript map providers in order to make it simpler to create applications with their API's

*Itâ€™s a work in progress (e.g. beta), so please be kind and 
contribute! Patches are welcome, but aren't guaranteed to make it in.*

## Usage

Very alpha usage as follows:

```
Carto.init(
